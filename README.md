Genetic algorithm deck builder for Clash Royale

## Problem
Clash Royale is a real-time video game combining elements of collectible card games (CCG), tower defense and multiplayer online battle arena. The collecting cards and building your own deck is the defining part of the gameplay. In this project we address the problem of completing the deck for user given that they want to necessarily include some cards in it. Although there are many tools providing the evaluation of deck, none can suggest what cards to add to the deck the strenghten it based not only on the results of matches from the game.

Gogidecks suits only for building decks for regular 1v1 battle, consisting of 8 cards. Each card may be either a troop, a building or a spell. Each card costs defined amount of elixir (mana), and has its own unique values of attack, hp, and other characteristics (e.g. the unit may be on the ground or in the air). We don't account the level of cards.
